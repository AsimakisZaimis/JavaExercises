Exercise 1

•Create a class called Bunny with an int bunnyNumberinitialized in the constructor.

•Give it a method called hop() that prints out which gerbil number this is, and that it’s hopping.

•Create an ArrayListand add 5 Bunny objects to  the List.

•Now use the get() method to move  through the List and call hop() for each Bunny.

•Loop through the ArrayListusing an Iterator

Exercise 2

•Move the Bunny class from Exercise 1 into a Map, and associate each Bunny (the value) with it's name as a String (the key).

•Use an Iterator for the keySet() to move through the Map, look up the Bunny for each key, print out the key, and tell the Bunny to hop().
